# dev-lunch-1

A sample repository for a devLunch presentation on GitHub Actions & Developer CI/CD.

-   This template is best complemented by two GitHub Apps: Commit Lint and Semantic Pull Reqeusts. Unfortunately, when using a template with these apps, the apps are not transferred to the new repo. You will need to install them manually.
